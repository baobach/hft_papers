# Hight Frequency Trading(HFT) Papers

A curated list of Quantitative Finance papers.

Due to the increasing interest in my project, I have updated the new format and address some issues with the first version. In this new version, I have updated the table format with brief descriptions and organized it in a separate folder which can be accessed [here](https://github.com/baobach/HFT_Papers/blob/main/hft_papers/papers.md).

Please reach out to me at robert@quantfin.net for any further questions. I will update this monthly and display the **top 20** recent papers here.

| ADHD Traits and Financial Decision Making in Stock Trading | MAX WITRY et. al. | While its effects on academic and occupational functioning are well established, less is known about how ADHD traits relate to financial behaviours, particularly in high-risk contexts such as online trading. This cross-sectional study examined associations between ADHD traits and financial decision-making in a sample of 945 active online traders. | [pubmed-40887485](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40887485) | 2025-08-31 |
| TradingGroup: A Multi-Agent Trading System with Self-Reflection and Data-Synthesis | Feng Tian; Flora D.
